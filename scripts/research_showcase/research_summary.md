# Consumer Performance DQN Research Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the CONSUMER PERFORMANCE FEATURE SELECTION process for DQN-based Kubernetes pod autoscaling.

**TARGET SYSTEM**: Consumer pod performance metrics with intelligent rate calculations
**FOCUS**: CPU usage, memory consumption, HTTP request patterns, and file descriptors
**GOAL**: Real-time scaling decisions through consumer performance analysis

## Dataset Statistics
- **Target System**: Consumer pod performance metrics with rate calculations
- **Total Samples**: 45
- **Selected Features**: 9 (performance-focused)
- **Methodology**: Intelligent data-driven feature selection

## Consumer Performance Categories
- **CPU Performance**: 1 features (usage rate)
- **Memory Usage**: 2 features (resident, virtual)
- **Network Performance**: 5 features (HTTP requests, responses)
- **I/O Performance**: 1 features (file descriptors)

## Scaling Opportunity Analysis
- **Scale-Up Opportunities**: 44 samples (97.8%)
- **Keep Same**: 1 samples
- **Scale Down**: Limited scale-down opportunities detected
- **Performance Optimization Potential**: High

## Rate-Based Benefits
1. **CPU Rate Analysis**: Real-time CPU usage rate patterns for immediate scaling triggers
2. **Memory Optimization**: Separate resident and virtual memory for precise resource planning
3. **HTTP Performance**: Request duration, count, and size rates for load-based scaling
4. **I/O Monitoring**: File descriptor usage for resource constraint detection
5. **Statistical Rigor**: Data-driven feature selection with scaling relevance scoring

## Technical Achievements
1. **Rate-Based Metrics**: HTTP and CPU metrics converted to rates for better scaling signals
2. **Real-Time Focus**: All 9/9 features are current performance indicators
3. **Consumer-Specific**: Focused on actual consumer pod performance, not infrastructure
4. **Statistical Excellence**: Scaling relevance scores from 87.7 to 120.0
5. **Zero Redundancy**: Each feature provides unique performance insight

## Selected Features (9 total)
1. **CPU Usage Rate** (relevance: 115.0) - Real-time CPU consumption rate
2. **Resident Memory** (relevance: 120.0) - Physical memory usage
3. **Virtual Memory** (relevance: 115.0) - Virtual memory allocation
4. **Request Duration Rate** (relevance: 100.0) - HTTP request processing speed
5. **Request Count Rate** (relevance: 105.0) - HTTP request frequency
6. **Request Frequency** (relevance: 95.0) - Request arrival patterns
7. **Open File Descriptors** (relevance: 90.0) - I/O resource usage
8. **Response Size Rate** (relevance: 90.0) - HTTP response throughput
9. **Request Size Rate** (relevance: 90.0) - HTTP request throughput
