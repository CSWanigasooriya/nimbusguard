# CONSUMER-FOCUSED FEATURE SELECTION - Research Summary

## Methodology Overview
This analysis employed dynamic metric discovery and advanced statistical methods to identify the 5 most critical CONSUMER APP METRICS from 100 discovered consumer metrics for DQN-based Kubernetes pod autoscaling.

**TARGET APPLICATION**: Consumer app (10.244.1.*:8000)
**DISCOVERY**: 100 consumer-specific metrics found
**APPROACH**: Dynamic discovery + ensemble feature selection
**GOAL**: Optimal autoscaling based on actual consumer data patterns

## Consumer Metric Discovery

### Target Identification
- **Instance Pattern**: 10.244.1.* (consumer pod IPs)
- **Port**: 8000 (consumer application port)
- **Job**: prometheus.scrape.annotated_pods

### Discovered Categories
- **Http Traffic**: 2 selected features
- **Process Resources**: 2 selected features
- **Monitoring Health**: 1 selected features


## Selected Consumer Features

The following 5 features were selected through ensemble ranking from ALL discovered consumer metrics:

 1. `http_request_duration_highr_seconds_bucket` (http_traffic)
 2. `http_request_duration_highr_seconds_count` (http_traffic)
 3. `process_resident_memory_bytes` (process_resources)
 4. `process_cpu_seconds_total` (process_resources)
 5. `scrape_samples_scraped` (monitoring_health)


## Dataset Statistics
- **Total Samples**: 893
- **Consumer Features**: 5
- **Metrics Discovered**: 100
- **Time Range**: N/A to N/A

## Scaling Action Distribution
- **Scale Down**: 107 (12.0%)
- **Keep Same**: 572 (64.1%)
- **Scale Up**: 214 (24.0%)

## Selection Methods
1. **Mutual Information**: Measures dependency between features and scaling decisions
2. **Random Forest Importance**: Tree-based feature importance from ensemble model
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Statistical correlation with scaling target
4. **F-statistic (ANOVA)**: Statistical significance testing

## Benefits of Dynamic Discovery
1. **Complete Coverage**: All 192 consumer metrics analyzed
2. **Data-Driven**: Selection based on actual consumer data patterns
3. **No Bias**: No predefined metric priorities
4. **Optimal Performance**: Best features for consumer-specific autoscaling
