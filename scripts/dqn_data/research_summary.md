# Advanced DQN Feature Engineering - Research Summary

## Methodology Overview
This analysis employed advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to identify the 9 most critical features for DQN-based Kubernetes pod autoscaling.

## Advanced Feature Selection Methods Applied

### 1. Mutual Information Analysis (Weight: 25%)
- **Purpose**: Captures non-linear relationships between features and target
- **Method**: Information-theoretic measure of dependency
- **Top Features**: ['kube_deployment_status_replicas_unavailable', 'kube_pod_container_status_ready', 'kube_pod_container_state_started', 'scrape_duration_seconds', 'kube_pod_container_status_running']

### 2. Random Forest Feature Importance (Weight: 25%)
- **Purpose**: Ensemble-based importance scoring with Gini impurity
- **Model**: 100 trees with random_state=42
- **Top Features**: ['kube_deployment_status_replicas_unavailable', 'kube_pod_container_status_ready', 'kube_deployment_spec_replicas', 'memory_usage_mb_ma_10', 'health_ratio_ma_10']

### 3. Correlation Analysis (Weight: 15%)
- **Purpose**: Linear relationship strength with target variable
- **Significance Level**: p < 0.05
- **Method**: Pearson correlation coefficient with p-value testing

### 4. Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (Weight: 20%)
- **Purpose**: Optimal feature subset selection with cross-validation
- **Method**: RFECV with 5-fold stratified cross-validation
- **Base Estimator**: Random Forest (100 trees)
- **Selected Features**: 6 features

### 5. Statistical Significance Testing (Weight: 10%)
- **Purpose**: ANOVA F-test for feature discrimination between scaling actions
- **Method**: One-way ANOVA with F-statistic ranking
- **Significant Features**: 38 features (p < 0.05)

### 6. Variance Inflation Factor Analysis (Weight: 5%)
- **Purpose**: Multicollinearity detection and removal
- **Threshold**: VIF < 10 (low multicollinearity)
- **Low VIF Features**: 30 features

## Final Selected Features

The following 9 features were selected through ensemble ranking:

 1. `kube_deployment_status_replicas_unavailable`
 2. `kube_pod_container_status_ready`
 3. `kube_deployment_spec_replicas`
 4. `kube_pod_container_resource_limits_cpu`
 5. `kube_pod_container_resource_limits_memory`
 6. `kube_pod_container_status_running`
 7. `kube_deployment_status_observed_generation`
 8. `node_network_up`
 9. `kube_pod_container_status_last_terminated_exitcode`


## Dataset Statistics
- **Total Samples**: 894
- **Features**: 9
- **Time Range**: N/A to N/A
- **Missing Data**: 0.000%

## Scaling Action Distribution
- **Scale Down**: 781 (87.4%)
- **Keep Same**: 0 (0.0%)
- **Scale Up**: 113 (12.6%)

## Quality Assurance
- ✅ **Statistical Significance**: All correlations tested at p < 0.05
- ✅ **Multicollinearity Check**: Features tested for high correlation (>0.8)
- ✅ **Outlier Handling**: RobustScaler used for outlier-resistant normalization
- ✅ **Missing Data**: Advanced imputation and validation
- ✅ **Feature Stability**: Coefficient of variation calculated for all features

## Research Impact
This advanced feature engineering approach provides:
1. **Reduced Dimensionality**: From 100+ raw metrics to 9 optimal features
2. **Statistical Rigor**: Multiple validation methods ensure feature quality
3. **Domain Knowledge**: Features aligned with autoscaling theory
4. **Reproducibility**: Comprehensive documentation and metadata
