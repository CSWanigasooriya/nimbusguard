# Scaling Approaches Comparison Analysis Results

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note: Temporal Alignment**

**Critical Context**: The three scaling approaches (DQN, HPA, KEDA) were evaluated at **different times** and for **different durations**:

- **DQN (NimbusGuard)**: ~30-minute evaluation period (most recent)
- **HPA (Traditional)**: Longer evaluation period (earlier timeframe)
- **KEDA**: Longest evaluation period (earliest timeframe)

**Analysis Approach**: Since simultaneous evaluation wasn't possible, we focus on **aggregate performance metrics** rather than direct temporal comparison. This is a common approach in autoscaling research where infrastructure constraints prevent concurrent testing.

## üìä Executive Summary
